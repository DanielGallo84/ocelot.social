## Benefits

How is ocelot.social different from other social networks?

- **Open Source:** The software code of this network is Open Source. This means that the code is public and can be copied, used, modified, enhanced and verified by anyone. You can contribute as a developer or translator to improve and enhance this project.
- **Not for profit:** Ocelot.social is non-profit, serving the public good. The network is developed and maintained by a non-profit association located in Germany, assisted by open source contributors around the world.
- **Privacy:** Your data will not be sold to advertisers and no user profiling will be done unless the operator of the network in question explicitly states this in its privacy policy.
- **Funded by donations:** The ocelot.social software is funded by donations which means that you may or may not give some love back by a donation or by other ways of contributing.
- **Self-determination:** Independence from the terms of use of the well-known major social networks: The operator of an Ocelot.Social network sets its own terms of use.
